- ## L103: Draw a line
    
    Description: A program to draw a line from 3 Lines of choice:
    
        Option 1 : Horizontal Line - ask for X-coordinate range and specific Y-coordinate and plot the line.
        
        Option 2 : Vertical Line - ask for specific X-coordinate and Y-coordinate range and plot the line.

        Option 3 : Diagonal Line - ask for inputs for example : the input : 5, 10; should plot the line (5,5) (6,6) (7,7) (8,8) (9,9) (10,10).

    + Language: Python
    + Dependencies:
        + PyOpenGL
        + GLUT
    + Directory: /L103
    + Main file: 3lines.py
